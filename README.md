# BronchialTreeModeller
Matlab based creator of threedimensional model of a human bronchial tree with a high degree of
flexibility with regards to geometric properties such as diameters, styles of branch connectors,
numbers of bifurcations within the tree, terminal elements for the last bifurcation generation
and algorithms for branch collision detection and prevention

Main_Program_Files contains all files needed to run the program in Matlab. The Program can be
started by running the start.m file (type "start" in command panel in Matlab).

Standalone is a distribution which allows to run the program without Matlab. In the standalone
version only containes all functionalities to create and view models. To load or save templates,
models or changes the Matlab version is needed and the standalone will return an error.

Anleitung.pdf is a guide how to set parameters to create the desired model. Furthermore it contains
information how to derive a printable 3D-model to print a physical model.

Ausarbeitung_BN.pdf is the master thesis which is written within this project.

Seminarvortrag.pdf is the presentation which has been created to present the project to external
listeners.
